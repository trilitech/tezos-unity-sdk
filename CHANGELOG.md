## [3.0.0] - 2023-01-09
### Added
- Tutorial scenes within the `Tutorials` folder, offering step-by-step guidance on SDK features.
- Centralised event management system `WalletEventManager.cs` for uniform event handling.
- `TezosManager` as a singleton pattern and as a prefab for easy SDK initialization and management.
- `TezosAuthenticator.prefab` to streamline user authentication processes with drag-and-drop setup.
- `TezosConfigSO` and `DataProviderConfigSO` for flexible and user-friendly SDK configuration management.

### Changed
- Folder restructuring and namespace adjustments for clarity and better organization.
- Renaming of classes and files across the SDK to enhance understandability (e.g., `DemoExample` to `Marketplace Example` and `NftApi Sample` to `Nft Api Example`).
- Refactored HTTP client construction to utilise `DataProviderConfigSO` for data settings.
- Namespace adjustments to reflect the new folder structure.
- Update of `package.json` to provide better descriptions and categorisation of samples.
- Improvement and consolidation of log messages and error handling throughout the SDK.
- Major code cleanups and refactoring across multiple files (`BeaconClientManager.cs`, `WalletProvider.cs`, `Tezos.cs`, and others) for readability and maintainability.

### Removed
- Obsolete scripts, e.g., `WalletProviderInfo`, `ApiTests` and Unity events and prefabs associated with outdated functionalities.
- Unused fields and refactored classes to remove redundant methods and streamline interfaces (e.g., changes in `IBeaconConnector`).

### Fixed
- Enhanced UI responsiveness and visual aesthetics.
- Resolved TypeScript serialization issues on the WebGL frontend.
- Bug fixes in `GetContractTokenIds` handling of zero token counts.
- Miscellaneous bug fixes and improved error handling throughout the codebase.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `TezosSingleton.cs` in favor of `TezosManager.cs`.

## [Migration Notes]
- Due to extensive changes, users are encouraged to review the changed file paths and updated namespaces to ensure compatibility with the new version.
